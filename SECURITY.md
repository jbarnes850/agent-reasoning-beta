## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at Agent Reasoning Beta. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to security@codeium.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

## Security Measures

### API Key Management
- All API keys must be stored in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use separate keys for development and production

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data is stored locally
- All API requests use HTTPS
- Cache data is temporary and encrypted
- User sessions are secured

### Code Security
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security patches are applied promptly
- Code is reviewed for security issues
- Input validation is enforced

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Use `.env` for local development
   - Use secure secrets management in production
   - Never expose API keys in logs or error messages

2. **API Usage**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use timeouts for all API calls
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Log security-relevant events

3. **Development**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use security linters
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Review security advisories

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be released as:
1. Patch versions for critical fixes
2. Minor versions for non-critical security improvements

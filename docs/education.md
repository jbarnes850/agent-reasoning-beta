## Introduction to Agent Reasoning

### What is Agent Reasoning?
Agent reasoning is the process by which AI agents:
1. Process information
2. Form logical conclusions
3. Make decisions
4. Explain their thought process
5. Build consensus with other agents

### Key Concepts

1. **Reasoning Trees**
   - Hierarchical decision structures
   - Evidence-based branching
   - Confidence scoring
   - Path analysis

2. **Multi-Agent Consensus**
   - Agreement mechanisms
   - Conflict resolution
   - Confidence aggregation
   - Collective decision making

3. **Verification Methods**
   - Logical consistency checks
   - Evidence validation
   - Cross-referencing
   - Confidence thresholds

## Learning Paths

### 1. Beginner Path

#### Understanding the Basics
1. Introduction to LLMs
2. Basic reasoning patterns
3. Simple agent interactions
4. Visualization basics

#### Hands-on Exercises
```python
# Basic agent interaction
from src.core.agents import Agent
from src.core.models import ModelConfig

agent = Agent(ModelConfig(provider="groq"))
response = await agent.generate_response("What is AI?")
```

### 2. Intermediate Path

#### Advanced Concepts
1. Multi-agent systems
2. Consensus building

engine = ReasoningEngine()
consensus = await engine.build_consensus([
    response1,
    response2,
    response3
])
```
